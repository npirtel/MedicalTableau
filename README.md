# MedicalTableau
CareerFoundry data analytics course project for a fictitious medical staffing agency preparing for an upcoming flu season.

A medical staffing agency provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as needed basis. The staffing agency needs help to determine when flu season is, when demand for staff is highest, and where to send staff based on distribution of vulnerable populations and flu deaths around the United States. A staffing plan will ensure that all available agency staff are sent to states as needed without necessitating additional resources and to optimize staff-to-patient ratios for each state.

I used data sets provided by US government agencies (US Census Bureau and CDC) to address key questions regarding time of flu seasons and demographics and locations of vulnerable populations.

## Technical skills
-> Use Excel and advanced analytical techniques (PivotTables, VLOOKUP, formulas, data integration) to clean and summarize data.

-> Tableau to create graphics summarizing flu deaths, including for vulnerable populations, and locations of vulnerable populations across the US.
